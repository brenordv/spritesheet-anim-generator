# Animation Spritesheet generator
This script was created to work with the package "Time Elements - Character Core Set" by finalbossblues.

The idea here is to grab the single spritesheet with all the animation frames and create several spritesheets, 
one for each animation, already taking into consideration the rules in the guide (included in the pack).
This makes the action of creating animations a lot easier and less error-prone. (Also I'm kind of lazy and didn't
want to deal with animations frame by frame).

Since it's a paid package, I cannot publish anything created using the package itself.
I will add a dummy test image later.

# Quick important note
I'm not affiliated with the author of the package in any way. I just bought some of his packs and their 
awesome, so I decided to create this script to speed up my tasks.
